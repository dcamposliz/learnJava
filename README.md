Some Java machine-learnig libraries worth exploring:

 - MLLib (Spark): For distributed processing. Faster than Hadoop. Currently undergoing rapid development. Supports Python and JVM languages.

 - JSAT: "Java Statistical Analysis tool" - created out of frustration with Weka.

 - Java-ML: Java API with collection of ML algorithms in Java. Limited capabilities.

 - Weka: Java library with GUI for running experiments on small datasets. Not recommended for production-type applications. Poor API.
